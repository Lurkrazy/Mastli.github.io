## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I'm a graduate student from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences(ICT.CAS). I have some experience on optimizing algorithms on CPUs like ARMv8 and
X86.

## News

I found there are not many works on sparse matrix-matrix multiplication with fault-tolerant

Recently, I'm doing some research on optimizing sparse matrix-matrix multiplication.

It seems like SC more likely to accept works about large-scale applications.

I finish my work ablohave a plan to submit a pull request to OpenBLAS, but I don't have enough time to test for all target architecture.


## Research Interest

My research interest is High performance computing, I like to optimizie any algorithm on GPUs and CPUs, I already have lots of experience on high performance computing.
