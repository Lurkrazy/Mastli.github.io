## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I am currently a graduate student at the State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CARCH, ICT, CAS), supervised by Prof. Yunquan Zhang. For more details, please refer to my [resume](https://www.chendi.gq/Chendi_Li_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Expected Graduation Date: 2022

I am looking for a Ph.D. program.

## Research Interest

High-Performance Computing, Optimized BLAS Library, Automatic Performance Tuning, Sparse Matrix Multiplication.

I am also eager to do some fancy Hybrid-Research like HPC+AI. :)

## News

2021.9.18 I found there are not many works on sparse matrix-matrix multiplication with fault-tolerant

2021.9.16 Recently, I'm doing some research on optimizing sparse matrix-matrix multiplication.

2021.7.13 It seems like SC is more likely to accept works about large-scale applications.

2021.6.14 I finished my paper. I have a plan about submitting a pull request to OpenBLAS, but I don't have enough time to test for all target architecture.
