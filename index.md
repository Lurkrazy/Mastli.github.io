## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I'm a graduate student from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences(ICT.CAS). I have some experience on optimizing algorithms on CPUs like ARMv8 and
X86.

## News

2021.9.18 I found there are not many works on sparse matrix-matrix multiplication with fault-tolerant

2021.9.16 Recently, I'm doing some research on optimizing sparse matrix-matrix multiplication.

2021.7.13 It seems like SC is more likely to accept works about large-scale applications.

I finished my works. and I have a plan about submitting a pull request to OpenBLAS, but I don't have enough time to test for all target architecture.

## Research Interest

My research interest is High performance computing, I like to optimizie any algorithm on GPUs and CPUs, I already have lots of experience on high performance computing.

## Publications

AutoTSMM:An Auto-tuning Framework for Building High-Performance Talland-Skinny Matrix-Matrix Multiplication on CPUs (IEEE ISPA 2021)
